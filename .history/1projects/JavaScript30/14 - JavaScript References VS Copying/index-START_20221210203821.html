        // start with strings, numbers and booleans

        // Let's say we have an array
        const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

        // and we want to make a copy of it.

        // You might think we can just do something like this:


        // however what happens when we update that array?

        // Here we are always copy a reference value of orinal array, 
        // it mean's if we try to copy the original array. We will end up with the reference value of it.
        // So, if we try to change the value of copied array, it will change the original array too.

        const team1 = players;
        team1[3] = "Khalid1";


        const team2 = [].concat(players)
        team2[3] = "Khalid2";


        // now here is the problem!

        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

        // one way

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in

        // or use the new ES6 Spread

        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        /*  We can copy array without reference of original array! */

        const team3 = players.slice()
        team3[3] = "badhon252"

        const team4 = [...players];
        team4[3] = "Badhon"

        const team5 = Array.from(players)


        // console.log(players)
        // console.log(team1)
        // console.log(team2)
        // console.log(team3)
        // console.log(team4)
        // console.log(team5)


        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

        // with Objects
        const person = {
            name: 'Khalid Hossain',
            age: 22,
        };
        console.log(person)
        const person1 = person;
        person1.age = 90;
        console.log(person1)




        // and think we make a copy:

        // how do we take a copy instead?

        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
